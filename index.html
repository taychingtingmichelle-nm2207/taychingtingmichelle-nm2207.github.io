        Social media has revolutionised the way people communicate, connect and consume information today. It has become an integral part of our daily lives and transformed how businesses and
        organisations interact with customers, helping them reach wider audiences and build stronger relationships. Social media has made news, entertainment and even personal interactions accessible 
        with a smartphone and this convenience is no doubt one of the best inventions of human kind. However, the use of social media also yields negative consequences. To name a few, misinformation, cyberbullying, 
        negative mental health effects and privacy concerns. 
        <br> <br> This data story seeks to provide you with a more updated understanding in the usage and impact that social media has on us today.

          These data are also based in 2022. The results tells us that <b>TikTok users are mostly contributed by people aged 18-24, whereas Instagram users are mostly those who are aged 25-34. Similar to Instagram, Facebook also shows that

          In addition, we can also see that the gender distribution for Instagram is almost identical as the only difference between the two gender percentage distribution is 1.6%. However, we can also observe that there are more male users 
          than female users on Facebook and that there are more female users than male on TikTok.

              According to a <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-global-overview-report">recent survey</a>, the largest reason people use social media is to 
              connect with their friends and family. As expected, social media is designed mainly for this purpose. From profiles, messaging, and commenting options to sharing milestones and daily updates, 
              there's very little about an individual (or even a business) that doesn't eventually find its way onto social media. Given that social media is visual content-heavy, 
              it is fairly easy to consume, and offers infinite scrolling, its entertainment value is extremely high.</p>

                digital platforms were used for cyber bullying, sorted by region. The survey showed that 76% of all responding parents 
                in Latin America were aware of social media as a platform for cyber bullying children. 
                <b>The global average knowledge about social media as a cyber bullying medium was 65%.</b></p>

                the results showed that most children in India and Malaysia were cyber bullied through social networks while children in China were mostly cyber bullied through mobile. We can also observe that the likelihood of children in china getting cyber bullied through online messaging and online chat rooms are 
                also very close to mobile. Unlike India and Malaysia, there are relatively few children in China that experience cyber bullying through social networks.</p>

                  tells us that <b>approximately two thirds of people aged 30 or under have experienced some form of online harassment. </b>
                  Overall, younger adults were the most targeted age group for both less and more severe forms of abuse in online settings, 
                  as well as being the only group in which the majority of people reported experiencing online abuse. Of the overall 64% of 
                  online harassment victims aged under 30 years, 
                  only 16% reported less severe forms of harassment, with the majority of respondents saying they had been targeted with 
                  more severe online harassment. Adults aged 30 to 49 are also more likely to be affected by more severe forms of online 
                  harassment as opposed to less severe behaviours.

          <p class="textcentralisedleft container2">The next significant effect social media has on the general public today is none other than mental health. 
            Some people can't help but to compare themselves with what their peers put online. Social media then becomes a platform where you develop a certain set of norms or standards and 
            and one such example can be women's current beauty standard.
            Some may even develop social media addiction and no longer seek authentic social interaction, which can eventually lead to depression and isolation.

           grew up at a time where technology had advanced rapidly. </b>Just by looking at the median, the people within the young age group are also more frequent users of social media and when we look at the range, people within the young age group holds the largest, 
           which also means that it has the highest variability in distribution. 
           Furthermore, we can also see that the data for all three boxplots are skewed to some extent. For the young and the mid age groups, the data are left skewed. 
           On the other hand, the data for the old age group is right skewed. Outliers can also be observed in the young and mid age category which would affect the mean of the data. This would cause the range to increase and therefore
           resulting in a less accurate representation of the data.

          Today, social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it has brought both positive and negative impacts on 
          individuals and society. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, share information, and connect with others. 
          This makes it essential to acknowledge and address these issues while utilizing social media in a way that 
          benefits us and society. <b>We ought to be mindful about our behaviour online and be responsible. After all...</b>

          Everyone has to be responsible in regulating their usage of social media in a manner that isn't detrimental to their mental health. Parents should be more involved with the lives of 
          their children and monitor their behaviour online, though it should not be done excessively to the point it violates their privacy or personal boundaries. 
          Although parents should pay more attention to their children's digital presence and behaviour, 
          I can also understand why it can be hard for parents to interfere or to provide a direct solution to help their kids to stop getting cyberbullied. 
          The thing is, cyberbullying or even bullying is a very 'mental' thing and to put it bluntly, it will not stop unless the person who is bullying stops. 
          it may or may not be solved by filing a compliant to the school. Of course, if there are evidence to prove of that the bullying happened, then the perpetrator will face
          consequences but in the event, the cyberbullying is done privately among a small community then it makes the situation even more complex.
          Those in power to influence negatively will continue to hurt others by making people fear them. As long as people at the side choose not to act and stay fearful, things will never change. 
          Cyberbullying is vicious and to learn more about it, you may read more

          <br><br>
          <b>In addition, youths should receiver stronger and more focused education on how to be safe and responsible online, starting from a young age.</b> Children today 
          grow up with advanced technology and are becoming more digitally literate. This emphasises how important it is for us who know better to provide them with the knowledge 
          they need to be safe and responsible with the power social media has. Especially for victims of cyberbullying, they should also be educated and be well-informed about the help
          they could get and learn how to reach out. 
          <br><br>
          Even if the issue isn't cyberbullying, other issues that are evident are social comparison and addiction. When we use social media and get to see what others are up to, 
          it becomes a source of comparison and if you don't feel that you are comparable to someone you compare yourself to, you will feel less about yourself. In the end, you will feel inadequate or inferior. 
          Furthermore, having an addiction can lead to depression and other sorts of mental illnesses that can harm your physical body apart from your mental one.<b> <i>All these goes back to one major 
          point which is the lack of self-esteem.</i></b> In boosting one's self-esteem, it is undoubtly a process that involves developing a positive self-image and believing in your own abilities and worth. More emphasis should also be put into helping youths learn and understand about the importance of self-care and their individual journey of improving themsleves as a whole. improving
          themselves can be a form of learning a new skill that they are interested in and only when one chooses to focus internally, then will one feel more confident about themselves. 
        <br><br>
          To conclude, I personally think social media has brought us a lot of convenience and good today, but we cannot ignore the bad that it has brought upon us as well. But at the same time, social media isn't inherently 
          bad but it is the people who uses it for bad intentions that are bad. The usage and impact of social media is a topic that people should constantly address. In brief, 
          all of us who are avid social media users, ought to be responsible users and stand up for what is right.
