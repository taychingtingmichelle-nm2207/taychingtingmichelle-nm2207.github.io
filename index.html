        Social media has become very essential in our daily lives for most of us. <br> <br> This data story seeks to provide you with more knowledge regarding the usage, impact, pros and cons of social media.

          These data are also based in 2022. The results tells us that <b>TikTok users are mostly contributed by people aged 18-24, whereas Instagram users are mostly those who are aged 25-34. Similar to Instagram, Facebook also shows that

          In addition, we can also see that the gender distribution for Instagram is almost identical as the only difference between the two gender percentage distribution is 1.6%. However, we can also observe that there are more male users 
          than female users on Facebook and that there are more female users than male on TikTok.

              According to a <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-global-overview-report">recent survey</a>, the largest reason people use social media is to 
              connect with their friends and family. As expected, social media is designed mainly for this purpose. From profiles, messaging, and commenting options to sharing milestones and daily updates, 
              there's very little about an individual (or even a business) that doesn't eventually find its way onto social media. Given that social media is visual content-heavy, 
              it is fairly easy to consume, and offers infinite scrolling, its entertainment value is extremely high.</p>

                the results showed that most children in India and Malaysia were cyber bullied through social networks while children in China were mostly cyber bullied through mobile. We can also observe that the likelihood of children in china getting cyber bullied through online messaging and online chat rooms are 
                also very close to mobile. Unlike India and Malaysia, children in China do not experience cyber bullying through social networks.</p>

              Focusing on the prevelance of cyber bullying in United States, we can refer to the polar and bar charts above. We can see that most cyber bullying victims are contributed by transgender as
              depicted in the polar chart. In addition, the horizontal bar chart shows that most students in the U.S mostly experienced receiving mean or hurtful comments from their account online and this result was also

                  This survey was done in September 2020 with adults responses within the United States. <b>Approximately two thirds of people aged 30 or under have experienced some form of online harassment. </b>
                  Overall, younger adults were the most targeted age group for both less and more severe forms of abuse in online settings, 
                  as well as being the only group in which the majority of people reported experiencing online abuse. Of the overall 64% of online harassment victims aged under 30 years, 
                  only 16% reported less severe forms of harassment, with the majority of respondents saying they had been targeted with more severe online harassment. Adults aged 30 to 49 are also more likely to be affected by more severe forms of online harassment as opposed to less severe behaviours.

          <p class="textcentralisedleft container2">The next significant effect social media has on the general public today is no other than mental health, as well as our emotional state. 
            When you see someone post about how great their life is online, some people can't help but to compare themselves with others and doing that makes them feel less aobut themselves. 
            Another quick example is how people also get into an addiction with the online community that they no longer choose to emerse themselves in authentic social experiences, leading to 
            depression and loneliness, in other words, isolation.

            In addition, according to a global survey conducted in 2021, 36% of respondents belonging to Generation Z felt that social media usage had a negative impact
            on social wellbeing. The feeling that social media negatively affected wellbeing declined with age, and just 21 percent of Generation X respondents felt that social media harmed social wellbeing.
            This statistic may not be that shocking to many as social media are mainly contributed by Gen Z to begin with. This would naturally imply that the likelihood for those to feel lonely 
            are no other than Gen Zs. Furthermore, Gen Zs also grew up at a time where technology had advanced really rapidly.

            Surprisingly, mostly reported that social media was not really a cause of sleep deprivation for those aged 18-25. After data cleaning, there were only 272 rows of data entries. 
            With a relatively small sample, the reliabiltiy of this dataset may be questionable. However, other possible hypothesis could be due to the time young adults spend on studying
            and several other stress factors that could have contributed to their sleep deprivation much more than social media would. But of course, more time and research will be required
            to verify this.
