      <p class="container1">In this day and age, social media has become almost a necessity for us. Furthermore, technology has advanced so rapidly that we even carry social media within our smart phones no matter where we are on the go. 
        By definition, social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and/or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. 
        Social media has become very essential in our daily lives for most of us. <br> <br> This data story seeks to provide you with more knowledge regarding the usage, impact, pros and cons of social media.

            Southern Asia had a total of 847 million social media users, whilst central Africa was home to just over 21 million users. And, if we generalise the data just by looking at the main 4 regions, namely Asia, Pacific, America, Europe, Africa,

            is still ahead of TikTok, having more annual users. Instagram and TikTok both are increasing at a steady and similar rate. However, the growth trend for Facebook can be seen to be going stagnant from 2021 onwards as the growth

          These data are also based in 2022. The results tells us that <b>TikTok users are mostly contributed by people aged 18-24, whereas Instagram users are mostly those who are aged 25-34. Similar to Instagram, Facebook also shows that

          In addition, we can also see that the gender distribution for Instagram is almost identical as the only difference between the two gender percentage distribution is 1.6%. However, we can also observe that there are more male users 
          than female users on Facebook and that there are more female users than male on TikTok.
